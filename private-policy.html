     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Sygra Publishing Inc.(“SP”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) respects your privacy and values the relationship we have with you. This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices with respect to information collected through our websites and any other online service that links to this Privacy Policy, including any websites and online services we operate on behalf of our authors (collectively referred to as the “Sites”).</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Please review our full Privacy Policy below before using our Sites. In particular, please review the sections: What Information We Collect About You (including information about cookies and similar technologies), How We Use Your Information, and Who We Share Your Information With. By using our Sites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Sites.&nbsp; We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u3623-11">What Information We Collect About You?</p>
     <p>The term “personal information” means information about an identifiable individual, including, for example, name, postal address, telephone number, email address, payment card information, signature, demographic information such as age and gender, and other information about an individual. We collect this personal information in the following ways:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u3623-16">Information You Provide Directly To Us:</p>
     <p>We may ask you to provide your personal information, including demographic information or information about your preferences or interests when you:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <li>Make a purchase on the Sites</li>
      <li>Enter a contest or sweepstakes</li>

     </ul>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u3623-41">Information Collected Using Technology:</p>
     <p>In addition to any information you provide directly to us, we and our third party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically collect certain tracking information when you interact with the Sites or emails sent to you.&nbsp; By using our Sites, you consent to our use of tracking technologies as described below:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u3623-46">Device Information</p>
     <p>We may collect certain information about your computer or other device that you use to access the Sites, including IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u3623-51">Usage Information</p>
     <p>We may log certain information about your use of the Sites (e.g., log files, clickstream data, a reading history of the pages you view, your search terms and search results) and additional “traffic data” (e.g., time of access, date of access, software crash reports, session identification number, access times, referring website addresses).</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u3623-56">Location Information</p>
     <p>&nbsp;Some of our Sites may deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature of the Site (e.g., enabling location tracking settings on your mobile device or browser). If you enable the location-based feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by the Site. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if a Site does not have that feature, the Site will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u3623-61">Cookies, Web Beacons, Local Storage and Other Similar Technologies</p>
     <p>SP and the third party service providers with whom we work may place, view, and/or use cookies, web beacons, local storage objects or similar technologies to collect information about your use of the Sites and other websites.

     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>A “cookie” is a small text file stored on your computer or other device when you visit certain web pages that record your preferences and actions.

     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>We may use local storage objects such as “HTML5” (the language some websites are coded in) to store information on your computer or device about your Site usage activities.&nbsp; This information can be retrieved by us to determine how our Sites are being used by our visitors, how they can be improved, and to customize them for our users.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>

Under such circumstances we would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. Nevertheless, we cannot ensure that an acquiring company or the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p id="u3623-184">Rights With Respect To Your Personal Information</p>
     <p>Depending on the jurisdiction, you may have the right to access, correct, delete, restrict use of or receive a copy of, certain information covered by this Privacy Policy.

     <p id="u3623-189">Changes to This Privacy Policy</p>
     <p>As our Sites continue to develop, we may add new services and features to them. In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Policy, or if other changes in our privacy practices or applicable laws necessitate changes to the Privacy Policy, this document will be updated accordingly. If we make a material change in the way we use your personal information, we will provide prominent notice of the change on the Sites and we may notify you using the contact information we have about you (including email address).</p>
